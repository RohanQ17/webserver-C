# 🌐 HTTP Server in C

A lightweight, fast HTTP webserver implementation written in pure C. Built for learning and understanding the fundamentals of web servers and network programming.

## ✨ Features

- 🚀 **High Performance** - Minimal overhead with raw C implementation
- 📡 **HTTP/1.1 Support** - Handles standard HTTP requests and responses
- 🔧 **Lightweight** - No external dependencies, pure C
- 📁 **Static File Serving** - Serves HTML, CSS, JS, and other static files
- 🛡️ **Error Handling** - Robust error handling and logging
- ⚡ **Concurrent Connections** - Multi-threaded request handling

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- GCC compiler
- POSIX-compliant system (Linux/macOS)
- Basic knowledge of C programming

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/http-server-c.git
cd http-server-c

# Compile the server
make

# Or compile manually
gcc -o server server.c -lpthread
```

## 🔧 Configuration

The server can be configured through command-line arguments:

| Parameter | Description | Default |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| Port | Server port number | 8080 |
| Document Root | Web files directory | `./public` |
| Max Connections | Maximum concurrent connections | 100 |

## 🛠️ Development

### Building

```bash
